0,Black Adam,"Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.",8
1,Black Adam,"Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.

What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.

This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.

And guess what? It works. Mostly.

Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing ""comic book to screen"" adaptation.

Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!",7
2,Black Adam,"What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).

And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.",8
3,Black Adam,"In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.

This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.

But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of ""who is really a hero?"" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.

If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.

I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!",7
4,Black Adam,"I had no knowledge about Black Adam prior to seeing the movie, haven't watched the latest trailers nor had any high expectations before going to the movie.

But wow, I was oh boy taken by surprise by the movie!

Okay, it's not the best super hero movie out there and doesn't have an overwhelmingly deep story. But it doesn't try to be that either.

It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!

And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!",8
5,Black Adam,"No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of ""Black Adam"". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!

So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a ""twist"" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to ""The Suicide Squad"" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say ""see look how brutal we can make this"" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with ""look how powerful and ruthless he is"". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!

It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" and of course a certain cast member from ""Shazam!"". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the ""Shazam!"" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!

The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's ""300"", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.

So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- ""Avatar"", ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like ""Venom""... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's ""Black Adam"", especially in a potential ""Black Adam v. Superman"" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!",6
6,Black Adam,"I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.

This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.

There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.

I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)",6
7,Black Adam,"""Black Adam"" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's ""Shazam!"". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.

Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.

Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical ""with great power comes great responsibility"" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.

I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.

To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.

As the film is a spin-off from ""Shazam!"", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.

It seems long overdue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.

The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.

Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like ""Black Adam"" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from ""Shazam!"", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.

I rate it 7.5/10.",8
8,Black Adam,"Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.

The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.

It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.

My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.

As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.",9
9,Black Adam,"Just an average superhero movie with a 2005 vibe which was odd but let me tell you . Dr.fate is so fricken cool , best choice d.c had . They should've called it black rock because all you see is Dwayne roided up acting like Dwayne . Action is non stop pretty much so it doesn't fail on that part . Story is kinda meh , typical dc writing . Atom , well there's going to be a lot of comparisons to Deadpool per say . It's a fun popcorn movie check it out, expecially for the casuals who don't know much about black Adam . I think the comic nerds might not like a lot of it but that's okay . This movie is not for everyone but if you're looking for a good time , this movie definitely hits that spot.",7
10,Black Adam,"Just finished watching black adam. Cgi is so good and visual effects are flawless. Fights scenes are brutal and fun to watch. Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.

This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.

At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.

So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.",8
11,Black Adam,"I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.",3
12,Black Adam,"I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.",7
13,Black Adam,"Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.

Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.

3.5/10.",4
14,Black Adam,"Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?

Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.

If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.",3
15,Black Adam,"Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.

That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.

The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.

The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.

That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.

Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.

This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.

I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.

Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.",5
16,Black Adam,"Was anybody really excited about Black Adam? Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.

Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.

Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.",5
17,Black Adam,"Rather than Action sequence , nothing shines . Black Adam is jus another rock movie with DCs super hero stuff . Average plot and poor effort from writers ( eventhough superhero movies contain same type of story , in this they just followed the usual template ) . Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .

Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .",6
18,Black Adam,"Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.

Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?

Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.

This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.

For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.",6
19,Black Adam,"There is little originality in this. No surprises. A few cringe moments. In other words, a typical Rock vehicle. Super-jarring to see any other parts of the universe stitched in as if they're supposed to fit (they don't). New characters introduced like we're supposed to know and love them already. The same Snyder-esque template (endless slow mo, dirty/dark palette). Dr. Fate copies literally every move from Dr. Strange. Hawkman annoying as hell with his bland brand of ""leadership"". And the villain, oh the villain...

It's like they used one of the new AI tools to auto-generate everything in this movie. It's as entertaining as masturbation. If that's your thing, cool.",4
20,Black Adam,"Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?

This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).

It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.

Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8
21,Black Adam,"Amid all the negative reviews and expectations of a The Rock movie, this was precisely what I expected. A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.

Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.",6
22,Black Adam,"Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.

The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.

It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.

It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.

Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.

Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.

Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.

The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.

And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.

It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.",7
23,Black Adam,"As far as superhero movies go, Black Adam was certainly above average.

First of all, great casting... every single main character was likable and believable, especially given the mythical and magical context of the film.

Sarah Shahi, Pierce Brosnan and Viola Davis add serious weight and grounding as well.

The Rock was definitely made for the title role but his American accent threw me most of the time. Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.

Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.

Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.

Solid 8/10.",8
24,Black Adam,"DC delivers again. I loved Wonder Woman, Aquaman as well as Zack Snyder's Justice League. Black Adam is right up there. It has everything you need for a super hero movie.

A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.

An original script.

Amazing action scenes.

You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.

I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre. Good times!",8
25,The Peripheral,"Just watched the first few episodes of The Peripheral and it was so much better than I was expecting. I never read the books, or even heard of them, so I had no idea what the story was about. Chloe Grace Moretz and Jack Reynor are both great in their lead roles. This is a sci-fi series that's both original and exciting. The storytelling will keep you interested and actually care about what happens to these characters. You do have to pay attention because it could get a little complicated but not bad. The visuals are also great. You can tell they put some money into this show. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this series goes.",8
26,The Peripheral,"Literally just finished the first 2 episodes and it's quarter to six odd in the morning here in England and I have to say I loved it, well worth staying up for.

Chloe grace Moretz was brilliant, just like she is in most things.

Some other really good actors in this as well, especially Burton obviously (not going to lie, I don't know all their names yet) but good performances all round if I'm honest. CGI is brilliant too, so much so I got seriously freaked out (The eyeball) .

Good story and premise so far and I haven't read the book and I don't read forums about shows I'm watching, so no spoilers for me lol!

And if you're like me and want escapism from a show, like any successful show of the past 10 years has been, then this will work a treat!

I know it's only 2 episodes, so my review might change come the end of the series, but if you like Westworld you'll like this too (yes it's made by the same person, or something along those lines, not 100% sure) actually if you like sci-fi at all; this is worth watching.

Will definitely be carrying on with this!

8/10 so far but like I say that could change by the end of the series up or down...and I'm thinking up!",8
27,The Peripheral,"It's refreshing to see a scifi show and escape the fantasy programming that permeates superhero and supernatural shows that dominate TV's alternate realities.

It's a good show. The characters are well-developed, and that's a trick when the action begins fairly fast, which is usually a sign that they are catering to the short attention-span crowd. To believe characters in their roles and be entertained early-on is a very good sign that the show is worth continued watching.

Moretz, Raynor and Goree are all very good. Also, it's nice it's set in the South, which is happening more and more on TV with fewer shows being stuck in the Rust Belt/L. A. and New York. It also hints at where VR may be going, even if we don't see it in our lifetimes.",9
28,The Peripheral,"In an era of new shows taking 3 or 4 episodes to get things going, I'm happy to report that this show gets going from the very first. What may have been another story with well-worn VR sim premise turns out to be a lot more. This is not some moody, slow burn suspense thriller-there's plenty of action and fast-pace story development. And it's a Nolan/Joy adaptation of a William Gibson story, so I'm sure it's going to get intricately deep like the early seasons of Westworld.

I did expect a bit more cyberpunk CGI for starters, but there's still time to introduce them. The story begins in 2032, so there's something to be said about not overdoing it. But you do get to see a glimpse of where the story is headed in the opening scene.

Maybe there's some significance to choosing what seems like a rural town in Kentucky or Appalachia, but I found the rural accents annoying and unnecessary. It works on Ozark, but I don't see the point here. Aside from this nit, acting is good, with interesting cast of characters.

I'm looking forward to more episodes. We need more good sci-fi!",9
29,The Peripheral,"I kept seeing previews for this show and decided to give it a try this evening. It was a pleasant surprise. The first episode was engaging, action packed, and fun. The second episode was not as good, but it's setting up the rest of the story. The premise is simple.....a VR/SIM player is trying out a new VR/SIM for money...or so they think. It's part spy, mystery and action along with sci-fi. Missing impossible meets quantum leap in a way. I really liked the first two episodes and will definitely keep watching. It's a very unique idea intermingled with a good story. Amazon has done good with the start of this show. It's worth a try.",8
30,The Peripheral,"If Stranger Things, Ozarks and Quantum Leap had a child, this could be it. There's enough story lines underway to keep us looking for the next episode for the foreseeable future. Mimicking, yet vastly improving on the 50's style SciFi where the film shows how social and technical advances blend into everyday life. One future London 2099, the other is small town America in the rural South in 2032. The writers assume chauvinistic attitudes continue to prevail. Burton , country goodboy, Is paid to beta test a cutting edge virtual reality device based on his high gaming scores. But those scores really belong to his beautiful, intelligent and compassionate sister. Flynn.. Burton and Flynn are caring for their sick, housebound mother and they need every dollar just to keep her pain managed. The writers imply Flynn's gender might lessen her shot at being selected to beta test the device. Obviously the device is somehow more than just a VR game, but so far Flynn and Burton remain naive. Flynn has to buy pain pills from the local backwoods dealers who are reporting to the local powerful politico (or businessman). Flynn is being hassled by to string y haired dealers when her wheelchair bound. African American vet stares down the villains. Later we see that he's got some sort of cutting edge tech built into his body, which pulses red under the skin and he has near superhuman eye hand coordination. Amazon has a lot to work with and so far they are making good use of it. Meanwhile in Flynn's virtual world, she's working with serious dark , covert group that whose scientists seem to be a mash up of Dr Mangela, and Q on steroids. And the opposing force nearly captures her virtual self and threatens to find out who's behind the avatar. Flynn decides to stop engaging in the simulation, but gets a call, then other messages suggesting she stay with it. The caller seems to be from the future and has almost magical access to her .I found it fun and intriguing.",8
31,The Peripheral,"I read the book recently for the first time, and would warn Gibson loyalists not to expect an adherence to the novel's focus and concerns. This is more like a riff on the novel's story than an attempt to recreate it on screen. The framework is the same ,but the story being told is rather different, no matter how many identical characters and situations. More clearly goodie/baddie with the sides in the fight getting more equal screen time than the book where the enemies of the protagonists are much more a hidden presence.

That said, the first two episodes have got me hooked and I'll now try to ignore it for a few weeks so I can binge more of it in one sitting.",9
32,The Peripheral,"... remains the top brand for series production today. It pretty much guarantees stellar writing, casting, direction, production. On top of that, this series was clearly intended to be a showcase for Amazon/Prime, so budgeting was never an issue either. Chloe Grace Moretz is a talented and charismatic actor who has been searching for a breakout role, and in this series she finally found it. Her natural charm and confidence are exactly the attributes that her character needs. In many ways it is unfair to classify this series as merely ""sci-fi"" just as it would be to attempt to classify HBO's GameOfThrones as ""fantasy."" This is entertainment, and premium entertainment at that. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",9
33,The Peripheral,"I didn't know anything about this show before watching the first two episodes. This show is fantastic. If you're a science fiction buff, then this is right up your alley. I was reading an earlier review where the person was bad mouthing Chloe's acting. That person must have a personal vendetta against her because she is fantastic in this show. When did she turn into such a beautiful woman?

Amazon has been coming out with some great shows and this looks like another. I like it because the acting is good, the cgi is good and the storyline seems original to me. I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the series.",10
34,The Peripheral,"Its soon, first 2 episodes is all we have so far, but this is high quality stuff. The southern accents are a little hit and miss, but that's an easy flaw to overlook when everything else is so compelling, cool, and interesting. Been waiting for a good epic sci-fi adventure to come out on a high end streaming service, and we might actually have that with this one. Im not familiar with the source novel, so cant compare to that.. but just jumping into this with no previews or trailers was refreshing and interesting. Acting, script, effects.. all solid so far. Will see how it goes, and update later if needed.",9
35,The Peripheral,"I considered rating this an 8 or 9 as giving a 10 rating when there are only two episodes available seems premature, but I do want to balance out the inexplicable 1-ratings.

The unfortunate ""ratings bomb"" trend where the unintelligent bombard any new show with ones for whatever ignorant issue-of-the-day they doth protest means those of us who actually watch the show and review honestly have to compensate by bumping our rating up a notch or two. It's silly but it only seems fair since there is, in fact, no value to reviews of those who do not actually watch.

Now that that is out of the way, I want to say I am very impressed with The Peripheral so far, and am looking forward to seeing more! I love that the show will be a weekly drop series, not a binge all at once, as I know it will be a fun one to discuss and theorize about in between. If you like shows set in the near future with what seems like very possible tech developments, with great acting and characters, this is a show for you!

It reminds me of a cross between Ready Player One, Westworld (same producer Jonathan Nolan) and a Black Mirror episode in the very best way. It is smart without being convoluted, mysterious without being frustrating, and original enough to be interesting but not to the point of feeling clueless while watching.

Westworld made the mistake season two of being too convoluted and have too many flash back flash forward what is real what isn't??, it appears this show learned a lesson from it and is following a better story format.

I have not read the book and do not intend to until the show is over, and will be avoiding all spoilers from book readers. That gives me the benefit of not constantly comparing it to the source material, so I am able to access purely as a television series.

So far, it's a complete success. In addition to the positive aspects I have already listed, the production is flawless in direction, cinematography, editing, scenery, and realistic costume design and accents for where and when the story takes place.

Haven't been this excited for a brand new original show in awhile!",10
36,The Peripheral,"The book is a masterpiece for me. I started wondering what was happening right away in the 1st episode of this series because it deviates so much from the book, and right away first scene. But after two episodes I'm happy to say the core is still there, and the way they're building a somewhat different story on the structure of the book's narrative is very good so far. I Love the way Gibson's and the series' characters show heart, wrestle with complex emotions, and don't take anything for granted. The world building and production design holds up well to the imaginative descriptions of the book. I miss the wonderful prose of Gibson's writing, but they've changed enough about the story to make this a must see even for those of us that have read the book. Bravo!

(edit 10/ 25: I was shocked to see the poor rating on metacritic after I wrote this... it makes me think that having read the book has given me more insight into and appreciation of the characters, and knowing what's coming (more or less) plot wise makes me appreciate what I've seen in the series so far in way that I might not have if I hadn't read it. If that's not it then I don't understand their poor rating - 57!! Ridiculous!)",9
37,The Peripheral,"This show is shot beautifully. From the graphics, to the depiction of futuristic technology it's just beautiful.

From minute one, you are pulled into another world (almost like the first season of Westworld) it's captivating.

Definitely worth watching! I didn't read the books or know that this show was being released but the trailer made me curious. It's a breathe of fresh... show.

For now, there's only two episodes but the characters have depth and the show makes you curious about their backstories. Cannot wait to see how the characters develop.

No complaints from me! Although some of the southern accents :) are cringy.

This show is great.",10
38,The Peripheral,"Don't read or listen to negative critics. Seriously read 3 articles about how this was a disappointing series.

Could t be farther from the truth. At least for the first 2 episodes, it has been a fantastic sci-fi kick of series

I have not read the books but the story and and the writ ring so far has been great. I hope the rest of the series is as compelling as the 1st two episodes.

I wonder if other organization pay these beat writer to put a negative spin on a great show so it doesn't take away from another series?

I'm hoping of this continues we have multiple seasons. Really looking forward to. Scifi series to take the place of the gap left by the Expanse.",9
39,The Peripheral,"I really loved the first episode. But after episode 3, I feel like it's not as complicated as they're making it out to be. The telling is complex but it's like a good enough idea that they could be more straightforward with it.

I was looking forward to the next episode but I feel like nothing really happened. And I'm starting to not really care.

The girl always figures everything out and so that's not interesting. Also I guess they're going for a Mamet type cadence but I'm not sure it works.

I would also like to say that I don't think I should have to write 600 words to critique at sure that's average at best.

Change the word limit to 200 max, IMDB!",1
40,The Peripheral,"It's not the worst show ever but the writing is extremely bland, the acting is subpar, and the characters are static and uninteresting. I will say that the cgi is really good, especially for a tv show, but ultimately it's just not worth suffering through 1+ hour episodes of the aforementioned problems just to see some cool effects and set pieces. It reminds me of Westworld if Westworld was less interesting and had a lower production value(it's from the producers of Westworld as well if I am not mistaken). I really wanted to like it because it definitely does have some redeeming qualities, but it feels like something NBC or similar would release, except the cgi is good and they can say the f word.",6
41,The Peripheral,"William Gibson's novels are usually difficult to get into. The reader is thrown in the world without any context. The terms are never explained and the reader needs to figure everything out as they progress. But once you get past the initial hurdles, you're rewarded with a rich world, nuanced characters, and a gripping story.

One thing that bothers me with the adaptation is how the characters are reduced to stereotypes. To put it simply, male characters are not misogynic a-holes in the novel and Flynne is not a Mary Sue. It's such a pity to see how new movies and shows feel the need to add unnecessary character traits that only demean the characters, while ignoring the larger themes explored in the novel.

Even the whole encounter between Flynne and Aelita is completely different and I think it was done solely for shock values and to inject more ""excitement"" in the pilot.

Overall, The Peripheral feels like a simplification, a dumbed-down version of what should have been.

Even so, The Peripheral remains quite interesting and different enough to be worth watching.",7
42,The Peripheral,"This is magnificent in every way.

Visually stunning to watch the filmography and artistic beauty is first class.

The actors are brilliant and have real power and charisma.

The story is exciting and suspenseful and totally hooks you in.

By the end of the first episode the suspense really ramps up and you are totally hooked.

And you will be pleased to know that it is much easier to understand and follow than Westworld. Joy and Nolan can get really carried away at times with some of their offerings , as they did in Westworld , which just became so convoluted you don't care anymore.

But the Peripheral is brilliant sci fi at its best.",10
43,The Peripheral,"I think that with all the bad shows coming out from streaming services, people's standards are getting lower and lower. All it takes is for a show to have a lot of glitter and people rate it highly. TV is supposed to be entertaining and maintain our attention. The Peripheral is boring. They try to do too much with too many characters thinking they will amaze us that way but what happens is there's no time to build characters and for us to know them. When the writers realize nothing happened for a while they insert a fight scene or some shocking moments and then it goes back to lame dialogs. Old 70's shows like Six Million Dollar Man did not have today's technology or budgets but there were no dull moments in them. I think we may have seen the lasts of the TV shows that make TV history like Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad or Boardwalk Empire. All they have now is Amazon or Apple money but zero creative talent. There will be few and far between exceptions in a sea of garbage.",5
44,The Peripheral,"I lasted 48 minutes. There's no real plot to speak of. Cliches abound. As soon as I saw the legless guy at the bar, I knew he would stick up for her. The bad drug pushers were obviously bad. Their boss obviously badder. The main character is supposed to be in this Appalachia town with ""few prospects"" but we never really get a sense of that, or the town, or anything. It's just a hodgepodge of pretty images. It's kind of like everything we've seen before and nothing really to latch on to.

David Mamet was right. Somewhere along the way, movies (and now series) became a producer's medium. We've lost the auteurs that bring us a distinctive vision, that immerse us in something authentic.

If you're young, you'll downvote this (or if Amazon pays you to) - but trust me, it was once better than these derivative, over-produced shows.

For good TV adventure, try The North Water. For something contemporary and amazing, The Bear. For something good about Appalachia, Dopesick. Anything other than this sizzling hot mess.",6
45,The Peripheral,"Omg! I REALLY hope they can keep this level up because I'm glued to the screen. Can't wait for the next episode. The story: Sci Fi series, ppl operate in very elaborated Artificial Reality (sims) to play games together, finish assignments and/ or make money standing in for wealthy not so gifted players. The main protagonists are a brother and sister from a rural town, low on the dough and their mother is sick, requiring a very expensive medication. She's even more gifted than him, though he gets hired for the lucrative jobs since he's a man and his sister is not (even in the future there's a wage gap it seems). She often plays for him instead, her skills are not from this world. One day, he receives a new type of AR helmet with accompanied assignment. He sends in his sister in his place, using his Avatar. The mess starts from there. If I need to give you a better description: i's a mix between the special unit from Black Hawk Down, the fake realities from the Matrix without the leather jackets and shades, some Ozark for flavor (the poor people trying to survive feel) and Kingsmen (you'll see why). You're wondering how they tied this together? Try it Absolutely worth the watch.",9
46,The Peripheral,"I was in doubt about trying this show, but I'm very glad I did. There's not a zombie, nor vampire in sight! They've combined AI with video gaming and come up with a very imaginative narrative! The acting is top notch, as is the writing. I was pulled into the story quickly, and was very disappointed when the pilot was done! I wanted, and got, another episode.

The story originates in the future, but in an economically poor, tiny Southern town. This is not the usual place we expect to see a story involving high tech. But remember, we're in the future.

I can't wait for this story line to unwind, and the mysteries to play out. I'm hooked!",8
47,The Peripheral,"It must take an amazing amount of talent to take a sci-fi story and make it so damn boring, I get that it's drama but drama by definition isn't supposed to be boring or has the world of TV & movie now decided to redefine drama as turgid , lacklustre & dull.

While it's a little too early to tell if this is going to be nothing more than a convoluted pile of pap it does open up some odd inconsistencies, such as in 2032 veterans have tech surgically added by which they can operate as a unit and hijack other tech but the one armed legless vet doesn't have prosthetics, instead he has a vehicle for mobility that looks straight out of a bad 80s sci-fi movie, yes it looks dramatic on screen but given that this plot is from a 2014 novel and advances in robotics, cybernetics & prosthetics are ongoing it makes little sense by the year 2032 the best he's given is an all terrain electric mobility scooter.

One of the most annoying aspects of this show is the awful accents, it's either stylised posh or gritty urban English accents or aggravating southern dialects, given some of the dialogue its like listening to a cement mixer churning & grinding.

Now quantum tunnelling is interesting but the concept is nothing new, this is the premise for the connection between the time line of 2032 & some 70 years in the future, it will be interesting to see if an actual explanation will be given as to how it works with connecting the future to the past and vice versa.

Got to laugh at all the 9 & 10 scores from the bots, clearly this show has been well thought out and professionally slapped together but anything above a 5 is really stretching reality.

This would've probably been much better as an all action movie but would've most likely been compared to ""ready player one"", unfortunately this is another of those ""mystery box"" shows so the info will be spoon fed to the audience in dribs and drabs.

Another annoying thing about this show is its from the same bunch that did Westworld, a one season story stretched out to a 4+ season show that got weaker duller and more convoluted with each season.

Gibson's novel of the same name has high praise but whether that novel can be translated to a TV show and win the adulation of a TV audience as well it has the book reading audience is something we'll just have to see. (pun intended).

After 2 episodes I honestly can't find a single character that is likeable or relatable, nothing about the story/plot is very interesting and every character is turned up to ""maximum setting"", quite literally there is no ordinary person in the entire show, its like watching a dull music video and everyone is acting over the top to try and make it more interesting.",5
48,The Peripheral,"As I was reading the reviews, I noticed a few complaints about the language used in this show. Glad to get those people out of the way because if you're judging a show based on foul language alone, you're not giving the show a fair shot. Plus, there appears to be a reviewer who has a real problem with Chloe Grace Moretz. Too bad. We won't miss you as a viewer either.

I had no idea of the concept of this show when I turned it on. All I knew was Netflix has zero that I want to watch at the moment and my additional streaming channels are the same. I'm not a huge fan of Prime original programming with the exception of The Wheel of Time. Were there things that needed improvement? Yes, but there was enough there that I'm looking forward to season two.

I'm not going to reiterate the plot as some reviewers have done an excellent job of giving you the gist of this show. All I will say is after 2 episodes, any series that neatly balances action and non-action, that's hired competent actors who are playing their roles well, has an interesting sci-fi plot, and pretty top-notch CGI is worth keeping up with. Will my score change? It's possible. But I'm going to give this show a fair shot. Foul language notwithstanding.",8
49,The Peripheral,"The high scores given to this bit of chaotic rubbish have got to be paid bots. The story is told with huge gaps and little in the way of context that helps viewers understand who the characters are supposed to be. The special effects are slick but the acting is appallingly poor. Most of the time, one has no idea what is happening and as the plot jumps between present and future, London and the American South, new characters appear, events happen and no explanation is provided to link them to the story. The result is just to chaotic to permit viewer engagement. One and a half episodes were enough to convince me that the series would not get any better or become more understandable and interesting!",2
